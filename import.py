# Import: Provided for you in this project is a file called books.csv, which is a spreadsheet in CSV format of 5000 different books.
# Each one has an ISBN nubmer, a title, an author, and a publication year.
# In a Python file called import.py separate from your web application, write a program that will take the books and import them into your PostgreSQL database.
# You will first need to decide what table(s) to create, what columns those tables should have, and how they should relate to one another.
# Run this program by running python3 import.py to import the books into your database, and submit this program with the rest of your project code.
